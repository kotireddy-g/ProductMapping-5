### Specific Implementation Notes
1. Chord diagram must have smooth animated transitions when hierarchy levels change
2. Product journey particles should flow continuously (use requestAnimationFrame)
3. All percentage values should have 1 decimal place
4. Currency values should use proper formatting (₹ symbol, commas)
5. Dates should be in DD-MMM-YYYY format
6. KPI trend charts should show 30 data points
7. Notification badges should show count up to 99, then "99+"
8. Session should persist across page refreshes
9. Implement smooth scrolling for horizontal product lists
10. Use skeleton loaders for initial data loading

Create the complete, production-ready application with all functionality working, realistic data flowing through all components, and professional UI matching the described requirements.
